Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Started auth-agent after db-agent completion.
- Confirmed worktree is on `refactor/auth` and clean before edits.
- Read project rules from `AGENTS.md`.
- Confirmed `PLANS.md`, `IMPLEMENT.md`, and `STATUS.md` were missing in `OA-auth`; created them for the long-term workflow.
- Analyzed Java auth controller/service/config and system login user provider at a high level.
- Identified that Java-compatible auth routes require modifying locked file `route/app.php`.
- Created public file change request before any route or auth business implementation.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `IMPLEMENT.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/tasks/public-file-change-request.md`
- `docs/tasks/auth-agent-java-auth-map.md`

### Test Results

- `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist`: passed; `vendor` generated locally and remains untracked/ignored.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse app,config,route -Include *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- `route/app.php` is locked by project rules, but Java-compatible auth endpoints need explicit route declarations.
- `vendor` is not present in the `OA-auth` worktree yet; `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist` is required before baseline ThinkPHP checks.
- auth-agent should not implement route or business code until the route change request is confirmed.

### Next Plan

- Run baseline checks after installing Composer dependencies if needed.
- Commit auth-agent planning and public file request.
- Wait for confirmation to edit `route/app.php` before implementing auth endpoints.

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Implemented the first Java-compatible auth code slice after the route public-file change was confirmed by the continued instruction.
- Added B-side auth routes for captcha, account login, phone-login placeholder, logout, current user, and safe password verification.
- Added unified JSON response helper matching the project API response convention.
- Added Token service using `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and Redis-compatible `oa:auth:` cache keys.
- Added RBAC service that reads `sys_relation`, `sys_role`, `sys_resource`, and `mobile_resource` to assemble role, permission, menu, button, and mobile button context.
- Added auth controller and middleware scaffolding for later protected routes.
- Documented auth-agent Phase 2 compatibility notes and deferred items.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `route/app.php`
- `app/controller/auth/AuthController.php`
- `app/middleware/AuthMiddleware.php`
- `app/service/auth/AuthService.php`
- `app/service/auth/RbacService.php`
- `app/service/auth/TokenService.php`
- `app/support/ApiResponse.php`
- `docs/tasks/auth-agent-phase2-notes.md`

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse app,config,route -Include *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed and listed the new `/auth/b/*` routes.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Java password compatibility still needs a dedicated SM2 decrypt plus SM3 hash slice; Phase 2 only isolates password verification and supports direct, PHP password hash, and SHA-256 fallback checks.
- Redis connection/store configuration is not changed in this phase because config files are locked and credentials must not be committed.
- Runtime DB verification requires a configured database using the mapped OA schema.
- Phone-code login and web-push behavior remain deferred.

### Next Plan

- Add Java password compatibility analysis and implementation plan before claiming full login compatibility.
- Decide whether Redis cache store config should be handled by merge-agent/test-agent or through a separate public-file change request.
- Continue with auth-agent menu tree shaping only after frontend-agent confirms required frontend route schema.

### Completed Content

- Analyzed Java password flow from `CommonCryptogramUtil`, `AuthServiceImpl`, and the old frontend SM2 login code.
- Confirmed `oa2026.sql` stores Java-compatible 64-character SM3 hashes in `sys_user.PASSWORD`.
- Added pure PHP SM3 hashing without introducing a Composer dependency.
- Added `PasswordService` and wired login verification through SM3 so imported Java user passwords can be checked.
- Updated safe-password verification to compare the submitted password before opening the short-lived `oa:auth:safe:` cache marker.
- Documented the SM2 boundary without writing any private key or secret into the ThinkPHP project.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `app/service/auth/AuthService.php`
- `app/service/auth/PasswordService.php`
- `app/service/auth/Sm3Hasher.php`
- `docs/tasks/auth-agent-phase3-password-compat.md`

### Test Results

- `php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; echo app\\service\\auth\\Sm3Hasher::hash('abc');"`: passed, matched the standard SM3 test vector.
- `php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; echo app\\service\\auth\\Sm3Hasher::hash('123456');"`: passed, matched the default password hash in `oa2026.sql`.
- `PasswordService::verify('123456', <SQL default hash>)`: passed.
- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse app,config,route -Include *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed and auth routes remained registered.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Existing Java frontend SM2 ciphertext is detected but not decrypted yet, because no SM2 private key or secret material may be committed.
- Full legacy frontend compatibility needs a secure SM2 adapter or a frontend-agent login adaptation over HTTPS.
- Runtime DB verification still requires configured database/cache services.

### Next Plan

- Continue auth-agent with menu/tree permission shaping and endpoint response compatibility.
- Keep Redis store wiring as a later public-file/config decision unless explicitly approved.
- After auth-agent reaches a stable checkpoint, move to user-agent according to the staged order.

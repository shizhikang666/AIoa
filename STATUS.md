## 2026-05-28 17:25 +08:00

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Started auth-agent after db-agent completion.
- Confirmed worktree is on `refactor/auth` and clean before edits.
- Read project rules from `AGENTS.md`.
- Confirmed `PLANS.md`, `IMPLEMENT.md`, and `STATUS.md` were missing in `OA-auth`; created them for the long-term workflow.
- Analyzed Java auth controller/service/config and system login user provider at a high level.
- Identified that Java-compatible auth routes require modifying locked file `route/app.php`.
- Created public file change request before any route or auth business implementation.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `IMPLEMENT.md`
- `STATUS.md`

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist`: passed in `OA-db`; `vendor` remains ignored.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.

### Current Issues

- `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA` currently shows an untracked `oa2026.sql` file. db-agent did not modify or commit Java source project files.
- `refactor/db` is ahead of `origin/refactor/db` by local commits and has not been pushed because remote push was not requested.

### Next Plan

- Wait for confirmation of the active plan in `PLANS.md`.
- After confirmation, start db-agent Phase 2 for high-priority OA business table analysis and passive Model generation.

## 2026-05-28 15:43 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Recorded the updated SQL reference file provided by the user.
- Marked `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL source for future db-agent analysis.
- Added a final-stage reminder for online realtime data synchronization into the completed ThinkPHP OA project.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/tasks/final-data-sync-reminder.md`

### Test Results

- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.

### Current Issues

- The SQL file is inside the Java source project and must remain read-only.
- Online realtime data sync is a deferred final-stage task and must not be started without a confirmed plan, backup, and user approval.

### Next Plan

- Commit the documentation reminder.
- Continue to wait for confirmation before starting db-agent Phase 2 implementation.

## 2026-05-28 16:05 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 2 for high-priority OA business tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java `biz` entity/table mappings and generated business table mapping notes.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 15 dependency-heavy business tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.

### Modified Files

- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `docs/tasks/public-file-change-request.md`
- `docs/tasks/auth-agent-java-auth-map.md`

### Test Results

- `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist`: passed; `vendor` generated locally and remains untracked/ignored.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse app,config,route -Include *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Phase 2 intentionally did not cover every remaining business/support table; additional low-priority relation and document tables should be handled in a later db-agent slice.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 2.
- Prepare db-agent Phase 3 for remaining database coverage, or move to auth-agent after the user confirms the db-agent foundation is sufficient.

## 2026-05-28 16:28 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 3 for sales project support tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java sales/product/follow-up/return/warehouse entities and mapper package coverage.
- Generated a sales support table mapping document for later api-agent, workflow-agent, and frontend-agent work.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 15 sales support tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.
- `route/app.php` is locked by project rules, but Java-compatible auth endpoints need explicit route declarations.
- `vendor` is not present in the `OA-auth` worktree yet; `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist` is required before baseline ThinkPHP checks.
- auth-agent should not implement route or business code until the route change request is confirmed.

### Next Plan

- Run baseline checks after installing Composer dependencies if needed.
- Commit auth-agent planning and public file request.
- Wait for confirmation to edit `route/app.php` before implementing auth endpoints.

## 2026-05-28 16:34 +08:00

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Implemented the first Java-compatible auth code slice after the route public-file change was confirmed by the continued instruction.
- Added B-side auth routes for captcha, account login, phone-login placeholder, logout, current user, and safe password verification.
- Added unified JSON response helper matching the project API response convention.
- Added Token service using `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and Redis-compatible `oa:auth:` cache keys.
- Added RBAC service that reads `sys_relation`, `sys_role`, `sys_resource`, and `mobile_resource` to assemble role, permission, menu, button, and mobile button context.
- Added auth controller and middleware scaffolding for later protected routes.
- Documented auth-agent Phase 2 compatibility notes and deferred items.

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse app,config,route -Include *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed and listed the new `/auth/b/*` routes.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Java `ProductRelation` declares `PRODUCT_RELATION`, while the updated SQL dump contains `product_relation`; the ThinkPHP Model uses the SQL physical table name and documents the mismatch.
- Finance/settlement and team collaboration support tables are still deferred to a later db-agent slice.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 3.
- Continue with db-agent Phase 4 for finance and collaboration support tables, or pause db-agent and start auth-agent after user confirmation.

## 2026-05-28 16:45 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 4 for finance and settlement support tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java collection receipt, debit note, settlement account, and account statement entities.
- Generated a finance settlement table mapping document for later api-agent and workflow-agent work.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 4 finance/settlement tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.
- Java password compatibility still needs a dedicated SM2 decrypt plus SM3 hash slice; Phase 2 only isolates password verification and supports direct, PHP password hash, and SHA-256 fallback checks.
- Redis connection/store configuration is not changed in this phase because config files are locked and credentials must not be committed.
- Runtime DB verification requires a configured database using the mapped OA schema.
- Phone-code login and web-push behavior remain deferred.

### Next Plan

- Add Java password compatibility analysis and implementation plan before claiming full login compatibility.
- Decide whether Redis cache store config should be handled by merge-agent/test-agent or through a separate public-file change request.
- Continue with auth-agent menu tree shaping only after frontend-agent confirms required frontend route schema.

## 2026-05-28 16:45 +08:00

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Analyzed Java password flow from `CommonCryptogramUtil`, `AuthServiceImpl`, and the old frontend SM2 login code.
- Confirmed `oa2026.sql` stores Java-compatible 64-character SM3 hashes in `sys_user.PASSWORD`.
- Added pure PHP SM3 hashing without introducing a Composer dependency.
- Added `PasswordService` and wired login verification through SM3 so imported Java user passwords can be checked.
- Updated safe-password verification to compare the submitted password before opening the short-lived `oa:auth:safe:` cache marker.
- Documented the SM2 boundary without writing any private key or secret into the ThinkPHP project.

### Test Results

- `php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; echo app\\service\\auth\\Sm3Hasher::hash('abc');"`: passed, matched the standard SM3 test vector.
- `php -r "require 'vendor/autoload.php'; echo app\\service\\auth\\Sm3Hasher::hash('123456');"`: passed, matched the default password hash in `oa2026.sql`.
- `PasswordService::verify('123456', <SQL default hash>)`: passed.
- `Get-ChildItem -Recurse app,config,route -Include *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed and auth routes remained registered.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- `settlement_account.org` is lower-case in the SQL dump; the ThinkPHP Model documents and preserves this spelling.
- Team collaboration support tables are still deferred to a later db-agent slice.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 4.
- Continue with db-agent Phase 5 for team collaboration support tables, or pause db-agent and start auth-agent after user confirmation.

## 2026-05-28 17:02 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 5 for team collaboration support tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java team project comment, reply, task comment, task category, team user, and task user relation entities.
- Generated a team collaboration table mapping document for later api-agent, auth-agent, and workflow-agent work.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 6 team collaboration tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.
- Existing Java frontend SM2 ciphertext is detected but not decrypted yet, because no SM2 private key or secret material may be committed.
- Full legacy frontend compatibility needs a secure SM2 adapter or a frontend-agent login adaptation over HTTPS.
- Runtime DB verification still requires configured database/cache services.

### Next Plan

- Continue auth-agent with menu/tree permission shaping and endpoint response compatibility.
- Keep Redis store wiring as a later public-file/config decision unless explicitly approved.
- After auth-agent reaches a stable checkpoint, move to user-agent according to the staged order.

## 2026-05-28 16:52 +08:00

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Analyzed the old frontend login flow after successful token creation.
- Confirmed the frontend calls `GET /auth/b/getLoginUser`, then `GET /sys/userCenter/loginMenu`.
- Confirmed Java builds the login menu from user/role resource relations and returns a tree for the frontend router.
- Identified a module-boundary issue: menu permission data belongs to auth-agent, but the compatibility route path belongs to user center.
- Updated the public-file change request with ownership options for `GET /sys/userCenter/loginMenu`.
- Added a pending Phase 4 plan and did not modify route or business code.

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Role and permission interpretation for team collaboration rows is intentionally deferred to auth-agent/api-agent.
- Remaining lower-priority support tables still need a short audit before deciding whether db-agent is complete.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 5.
- Run db-agent Phase 6 remaining support table audit, then decide whether to stop db-agent and begin auth-agent.

## 2026-05-28 17:14 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 6 remaining support table audit.
- Compared Java biz entities against generated ThinkPHP Models.
- Documented remaining low-priority or shared tables that are not required for auth-agent startup.
- Decided that db-agent can pause and hand over to auth-agent.
- Kept this phase documentation-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.
- `docs/tasks/public-file-change-request.md`

### Test Results

- No code was changed in this boundary-planning step.
- Previous Phase 3 checks remain passing in this clean worktree state.
- `git status --short --branch`: will be checked before committing this planning update.

### Current Issues

- `GET /sys/userCenter/loginMenu` requires an ownership decision before implementation because it may overlap auth-agent and user-agent responsibilities.
- Implementing the compatibility route requires modifying locked `route/app.php`.

### Next Plan

- Wait for confirmation on the login menu route ownership option.
- If confirmed for auth-agent, implement only menu tree compatibility and avoid user profile/organization/workbench APIs.
- If deferred to user-agent or merge-agent, keep auth-agent code as login, token, password, RBAC, and permission foundation.

## 2026-05-28 17:13 +08:00

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Started multi-agent parallel work with user-agent, test-agent, and docs-agent in separate worktrees.
- Implemented auth-owned compatibility for `GET /sys/userCenter/loginMenu`.
- Added menu tree building from `SYS_USER_HAS_RESOURCE` and `SYS_ROLE_HAS_RESOURCE`.
- Added parent menu/module inclusion and frontend-compatible `meta` fields for router loading.
- Kept user center ownership narrow: no user profile, organization, position, workbench, process config, or message APIs were implemented.
- Updated the public-file change request status for the single route addition.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/database/remaining-table-audit.md`

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.

- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed and listed `sys/userCenter/loginMenu`.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Remaining unmapped low-priority tables include `biz_draft`, `biz_history_excel`, `biz_payroll`, `biz_user_vacation`, `BIZ_RELATION`, `DEV_FILE`, and `DEV_DICT`.
- These do not block auth-agent startup and can be handled by later agents or a small db-agent follow-up if a concrete dependency appears.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 6 audit.
- Start auth-agent next in `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA-auth` after confirming branch/worktree status and syncing the latest db-agent foundation strategy into the handoff plan.

## 2026-05-29 09:55 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 7 workflow engine table model coverage.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Added passive ThinkPHP Models for Camunda-style `act_*` runtime, repository, and history tables.
- Added `ActBaseModel` with `ID_` as the primary key for Camunda-compatible tables.
- Documented workflow engine model coverage and final data sync implications.
- Kept this phase database/model-only with no controller, service, route, workflow runtime, or side-effect logic.
- Runtime DB verification still requires a configured OA database and cache store.
- The rest of `/sys/userCenter/*` remains for user-agent.
- If user-agent later implements a richer `loginMenu`, merge-agent must keep only one route and compare output compatibility.

### Next Plan

- Commit auth-agent Phase 4.
- Wait for user-agent/test-agent/docs-agent reports.
- Review parallel agent outputs before starting the next module slice.

## 2026-05-29 10:25 +08:00

Agent: auth-agent

### Completed Content

- Added frontend-compatible `msg` field to unified API responses.
- Preserved the existing `message` field and response shape.
- Kept the change limited to response compatibility with no auth/token/RBAC behavior changes.

- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- These models are passive wrappers only; workflow runtime behavior remains workflow-agent scope.
- Active process/task data must be included in the final online realtime data synchronization plan after project completion.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 7.
- workflow-agent can later build read-only query services on these models after final merge order brings db-agent first.
- `app/support/ApiResponse.php`

### Test Results

- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed and listed auth/login/menu routes.
- PHP lint for `app`, `config`, and `route`: passed.

### Current Issues

- Old frontend and new backend docs now both have a response message field, but later frontend-agent should decide whether to keep dual fields permanently or remove `msg` after frontend migration.

### Next Plan

- Run baseline checks.
- Commit auth-agent Phase 5.

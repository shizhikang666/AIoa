### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist`: passed in `OA-db`; `vendor` remains ignored.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.

### Current Issues

- `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA` currently shows an untracked `oa2026.sql` file. db-agent did not modify or commit Java source project files.
- `refactor/db` is ahead of `origin/refactor/db` by local commits and has not been pushed because remote push was not requested.

### Next Plan

- Wait for confirmation of the active plan in `PLANS.md`.
- After confirmation, start db-agent Phase 2 for high-priority OA business table analysis and passive Model generation.

## 2026-05-28 15:43 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Recorded the updated SQL reference file provided by the user.
- Marked `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL source for future db-agent analysis.
- Added a final-stage reminder for online realtime data synchronization into the completed ThinkPHP OA project.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/tasks/final-data-sync-reminder.md`

### Test Results

- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.

### Current Issues

- The SQL file is inside the Java source project and must remain read-only.
- Online realtime data sync is a deferred final-stage task and must not be started without a confirmed plan, backup, and user approval.

### Next Plan

- Commit the documentation reminder.
- Continue to wait for confirmation before starting db-agent Phase 2 implementation.

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 2 for high-priority OA business tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java `biz` entity/table mappings and generated business table mapping notes.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 15 dependency-heavy business tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Phase 2 intentionally did not cover every remaining business/support table; additional low-priority relation and document tables should be handled in a later db-agent slice.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 2.
- Prepare db-agent Phase 3 for remaining database coverage, or move to auth-agent after the user confirms the db-agent foundation is sufficient.

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 3 for sales project support tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java sales/product/follow-up/return/warehouse entities and mapper package coverage.
- Generated a sales support table mapping document for later api-agent, workflow-agent, and frontend-agent work.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 15 sales support tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Java `ProductRelation` declares `PRODUCT_RELATION`, while the updated SQL dump contains `product_relation`; the ThinkPHP Model uses the SQL physical table name and documents the mismatch.
- Finance/settlement and team collaboration support tables are still deferred to a later db-agent slice.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 3.
- Continue with db-agent Phase 4 for finance and collaboration support tables, or pause db-agent and start auth-agent after user confirmation.

## 2026-05-28 16:45 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 4 for finance and settlement support tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java collection receipt, debit note, settlement account, and account statement entities.
- Generated a finance settlement table mapping document for later api-agent and workflow-agent work.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 4 finance/settlement tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- `settlement_account.org` is lower-case in the SQL dump; the ThinkPHP Model documents and preserves this spelling.
- Team collaboration support tables are still deferred to a later db-agent slice.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 4.
- Continue with db-agent Phase 5 for team collaboration support tables, or pause db-agent and start auth-agent after user confirmation.

## 2026-05-28 17:02 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 5 for team collaboration support tables.
- Used `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA\oa2026.sql` as the primary read-only SQL reference.
- Analyzed Java team project comment, reply, task comment, task category, team user, and task user relation entities.
- Generated a team collaboration table mapping document for later api-agent, auth-agent, and workflow-agent work.
- Generated passive ThinkPHP Models for 6 team collaboration tables.
- Kept all generated Models database-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Role and permission interpretation for team collaboration rows is intentionally deferred to auth-agent/api-agent.
- Remaining lower-priority support tables still need a short audit before deciding whether db-agent is complete.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 5.
- Run db-agent Phase 6 remaining support table audit, then decide whether to stop db-agent and begin auth-agent.

## 2026-05-28 17:14 +08:00

Agent: db-agent

### Completed Content

- Completed db-agent Phase 6 remaining support table audit.
- Compared Java biz entities against generated ThinkPHP Models.
- Documented remaining low-priority or shared tables that are not required for auth-agent startup.
- Decided that db-agent can pause and hand over to auth-agent.
- Kept this phase documentation-only, with no controller, service, route, workflow, auth, or frontend logic.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/database/remaining-table-audit.md`

### Test Results

- `Get-ChildItem app\model -Filter *.php | ForEach-Object { php -l $_.FullName }`: passed.
- `composer dump-autoload`: passed.
- `php think`: passed, ThinkPHP version `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list`: passed.
- `php think test`: not run because the current ThinkPHP console does not expose a `test` command.

### Current Issues

- Remaining unmapped low-priority tables include `biz_draft`, `biz_history_excel`, `biz_payroll`, `biz_user_vacation`, `BIZ_RELATION`, `DEV_FILE`, and `DEV_DICT`.
- These do not block auth-agent startup and can be handled by later agents or a small db-agent follow-up if a concrete dependency appears.
- Online realtime production data synchronization remains a final-stage requirement and must wait until the merged ThinkPHP OA project is complete and a confirmed sync plan exists.
- `refactor/db` remains ahead of `origin/refactor/db`; no push has been performed.

### Next Plan

- Commit db-agent Phase 6 audit.
- Start auth-agent next in `F:\AI\projects\testJava\OA-auth` after confirming branch/worktree status and syncing the latest db-agent foundation strategy into the handoff plan.

Agent: user-agent

### Completed Content

- Started user-agent Phase 1 after db-agent/auth-agent foundations.
- Confirmed `OA-user` worktree is clean before edits.
- Created long-term workflow files for user-agent.
- Analyzed Java user, user-center, org, and position controllers at API level.
- Analyzed primary database tables from `oa2026.sql`.
- Documented module boundaries, route risks, and next implementation order.

### Modified Files

- `PLANS.md`
- `IMPLEMENT.md`
- `STATUS.md`
- `docs/tasks/user-agent-java-map.md`
- `docs/tasks/user-agent-phase1-notes.md`

### Test Results

- Phase 1 is documentation only.
- `composer install --no-interaction --prefer-dist` restored the local `vendor` directory because it was missing in this worktree.
- `composer dump-autoload` passed.
- `php think` passed and reported ThinkPHP `8.1.4`.
- `php think route:list` passed with only baseline routes in this branch.
- PHP syntax lint passed for `app`, `config`, and `route`.
- `git diff --check` passed.

### Current Issues

- user-agent must not duplicate auth-agent's `GET /sys/userCenter/loginMenu` route.
- User grant role/resource/permission operations overlap auth-agent RBAC data and need a clear boundary.
- Import/export, avatar upload, and encrypted profile fields should be deferred.

### Next Plan

- Implement read-only organization and position tree/query services first.
- Then implement user page/detail selectors.
- Defer write operations, grants, import/export, and uploads until API routing ownership is confirmed.
